                    It is critical that every business needs a function performed by our Payroll professionals under the CSR accounting team. The payroll involves managing all employee compensation, benefits, and withholdings.

                    We manage your payroll on an ongoing basis, ensuring that all employees are compensated according to their employment agreements and benefits sections. 
                </p>

                <h1 class="heading">Payroll Funding</h1>
                <p>
                    CSR provides quick payroll preparation and in case capital is not sufficient to cover the payroll, We do fund our clients, by paying the salaries of approved payroll. This gives our clients a sit-back and focuses on the main activities that will grow the business.

                    Our funding is on a one-off commission which is agreed in a contract.
